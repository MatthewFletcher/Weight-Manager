# All Entries Help

- The table shows all current entries.
- **Select/Deselect All:** To select or deselect all entries at once, click the checkbox at the top left of the table (in the header row). This will toggle all checkboxes in the list.
    - If you select or deselect individual checkboxes, the select-all box will automatically update to show whether all, none, or some entries are selected (a dash means some are selected).
- **Range Selection:** You can also use **Shift+Click**: Click one checkbox, then Shift+Click another to select or deselect a range of entries in between.
- **Add Weight:** To add a new weight for a person, use the "Add Weight" field and button in the rightmost column of that person's row.
- **Viewing Weights:** The list of weights for each person is shown, aligned so each weight column matches across rows.
- **Sorting:** Click on a column header to sort the table by that column (except for the checkbox and Add Weight columns).
- **Deleting Entries:** To delete one or more entries, check the boxes next to those entries and click **Delete Selected** at the bottom.
- **PDF Report:** Use **Generate PDF Report** to create a printable summary of the current entries.
- You can switch between buildings using the drop down menu at the top of the page.

**Tip:**  
If you see a dash (`-`) in the select-all checkbox, that means only some entries are selected. You can click it to select or deselect all at once.
